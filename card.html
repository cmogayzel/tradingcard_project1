			<p>I like the bald eagle because of this strength. It represents a nation.
				The bald egale and swoop down at a speed of 20 or 30 mph </br> and catch a fish 
				out of the water and this allows it to carry more weight under its tallons. </br>
				The Bald egale is protected from hunting and it is a federal crime to kill a bald eagle.
